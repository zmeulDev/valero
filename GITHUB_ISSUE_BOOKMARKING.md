bookmarks
├── id (bigint, primary)
├── user_id (foreign key, indexed)
├── title (string)
├── link (text, nullable)
├── notes (text, nullable)
├── category (string, nullable, indexed)
└── timestamps
```

### Key Features

- Romanian (`resources/lang/ro/admin.php`)
- Spanish (`resources/lang/es/admin.php`)

All UI strings, messages, and labels are fully translatable.
