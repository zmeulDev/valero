## üóÇ Application Structure

The application follows the standard **Laravel** structure with a focus on component-based architecture using **Livewire**.

### Key Components:

- **Article Management**: Articles can be created, edited, scheduled, and published, with options for adding featured images and gallery images.
- **Category Management**: Categories can be dynamically created via a Livewire modal and are used to organize articles.
- **Admin Panel**: The admin interface allows full CRUD operations on articles and categories, with optimized UI for usability and a modern look.

### Blade Components and Layouts:

- `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php`: The main layout used in the admin panel for managing articles, categories, and users.
- `resources/views/livewire/create-category-modal.blade.php`: A Livewire-powered modal for creating categories.

### Routes:

Key routes for the application are defined in `routes/web.php`. Some important routes include:

- `/admin/articles`: CRUD routes for managing articles.
- `/admin/categories`: CRUD routes for managing categories.
- `/admin/articles/{article}/images/{image}`: Route for deleting images from an article's gallery.
- `/articles/{article}`: Public route for viewing an article.
- `/categories/{category}`: Public route for viewing articles in a category.

### Livewire Components:

1. **`CreateCategoryModal`**:
   - A dynamic modal for creating categories.
   - Triggered by emitting Livewire events from other Blade files.
   - Provides real-time feedback and form validation.

### Example Routes

  - `POST /admin/categories`: Store a new category via modal or form.

### Article Model

The `Article` model represents a blog article and includes the following relationships:

- `category`: Belongs to a category.
- `images`: Has many images.
- `tags`: Belongs to many tags.

### SEO Implementation

The project uses the **RalphJSmit/Laravel/SEO** package to handle SEO-related functionality. This package provides features such as:
